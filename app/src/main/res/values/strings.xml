    <string name="textview">Art songs are songs created for performance by classical artists, usually with piano accompaniment,
        although they can be sung solo. Art songs require strong vocal technique, understanding of language,
        diction and poetry for interpretation. Though such singers may also perform popular or folk songs on their programs,
